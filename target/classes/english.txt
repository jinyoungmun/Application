Hi! I am Tom.
Nice to meet you.
You must be John.
Where are you from?
What do you do for a living?
What do you usually do in your free time?
Do you have Facebook account?
How are you today?
How’s it going?
How have you been these days?
What brings you here today?
How’s the weather outside?
How’s your family?
What’s up?
What’s new?
I’ve been busy lately.
I’ve heard so much about you.
I’ve been looking forward to meeting you
I really appreciate it.
Do you have a minute to talk?
I’d like to introduce you to my boss.
What is your phone number?
Would you like a drink?
How do you feel about him?
I’m returning your call.
Can you tell me your story?
Would you happen to know the story?
I have no idea what you're saying.
I’m not really sure where the cat is.
Do you agree with me?
Do you know what I mean?
what do you think about the movie?
Don’t you think that is good enough?
No, thanks. I’m OK.
I’m planning to go hiking.
I’m single and ready to mingle.
I’m divorced three years ago.
No problem.
It was the least I could do for you.
I’d like you to meet my father.
It was nice chatting with you after a long time.
Could you do me a favor?
You crossed my mind
I appreciate your help.
I feel sad without you.
You inspire me.
You are my reason for living.
You occupy my thoughts.
I adore you.
I don't want to be adored, I want to be loved.
You’re everything to me.
You’re the light of my life.
We appreciate the offer.
I’m not really into it, but thanks for buying!
I’d rather not, thanks.
That’s not going to work for me.
Sounds fun, but I’m not available at this moment.
I want to, but I’m unable to do this.
If you ask me, they're making a mistake.
I don’t have strong feelings either way.
That’s so true.
I beg to differ.
It's worth a go.
That’s not how I see it.
Congratulations!
That’s terrible.
I’m so sorry to hear that.
Let me check my calendar.
Sounds great!
I beg your pardon?
What do you mean by that?
Do you understand what I’m saying?
Is that clear?
I need a little help.
Could you do me a favor?
Keep up the good work!
Long time, no see.
What are you been up to?
Nice to see you again.
Look who it is in front of the door!
What have you been doing these days?
Excuse me?
That’s a shame.
That sounds awful.
Do you mind repeating that story?
Sorry, I didn’t catch that.
I’m not happy about the fact that I cannot be with you.
That job is a piece of cake.
How much is this shirt?
I’m starving to death!
I’m full right now.
I love this program!
Do you have any bags to check?
Your flight has been canceled.
No matter what happens, I’m going to do this.
I’m sorry for being late.
I was tied up in a meeting so I couldn't attend the party.
I’m afraid you’re right.
No, you’ve got it wrong.
She’s brilliant and deligent.
He’s a bit slow but steady.
Are you finished for the day?
Have a safe journey.
